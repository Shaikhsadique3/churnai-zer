## Post 2: Problem/Solution (LinkedIn)

The most painful moment as a SaaS founder:

Logging in to see another customer canceled.

No warning. No complaint. No chance to save them.

Sound familiar? You're not alone.

Most SaaS tools only tell you about churn AFTER it happens. That's like trying to catch a falling glass after it hits the ground.

Churnaizer changes this. Our AI analyzes user behavior to predict churn risk 30-60 days early.

When someone's about to leave, you get:
‚Üí Real-time alerts
‚Üí Automated retention emails  
‚Üí Specific reasons why they're at risk
‚Üí Recommended actions to save them

Beta customer results:
‚Ä¢ TaskFlow: 8% ‚Üí 4.2% churn in 3 months
‚Ä¢ DataSync: $180k revenue saved in 6 months
‚Ä¢ CloudBase: 3x team efficiency

Stop reacting to churn. Start preventing it.

## Post 3: Founder Story (Twitter Thread)

üßµ The $2,400 lesson that led me to build Churnaizer

1/ Last year, our biggest customer canceled without warning.
$2,400 ARR gone. No declining usage signals. No support tickets.
Just... gone.

2/ That's when I realized our churn approach was broken.
We were being REACTIVE instead of PROACTIVE.
By the time we knew someone was leaving, they'd already decided.

3/ The stats are brutal:
‚Ä¢ 5-7% monthly churn is "normal"
‚Ä¢ 5-25x more expensive to acquire vs retain
‚Ä¢ Most founders only discover churn after it happens

4/ So we built the early warning system we wished we had.
Churnaizer uses AI to predict churn 30-60 days early.
94% accuracy. Automated retention. Real results.

5/ Beta customers are seeing incredible results:
‚Ä¢ 47% churn reduction
‚Ä¢ $240k+ revenue saved
‚Ä¢ 3x more recoveries

6/ Today, Churnaizer is live for all SaaS founders.

Stop losing customers. Start saving them. üöÄ
