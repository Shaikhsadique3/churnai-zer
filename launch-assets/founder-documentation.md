# Churnaizer: The Complete Founder's Guide

## What is Churnaizer?

Churnaizer is like having a crystal ball for your SaaS business. It uses artificial intelligence to predict which customers are likely to cancel their subscriptions before they actually do - giving you time to save them.

Think of it as an early warning system for customer churn, combined with automated tools to win back at-risk customers.

## Why Do You Need This?

### The Hidden Cost of Churn
- **Average SaaS churn rate**: 5-7% monthly
- **Cost to acquire new customer**: 5-25x more than retaining existing ones
- **Revenue impact**: A 1% reduction in churn can increase company value by 12%

### What Churnaizer Solves
- **Reactive approach**: You only know customers churned after they cancel
- **Manual monitoring**: Impossible to track hundreds of user signals manually
- **Generic retention**: One-size-fits-all emails that don't work
- **No data insights**: Can't measure what's working in retention efforts

## How Churnaizer Works (Non-Technical)

### 1. Data Collection
Our small piece of code (called an SDK) sits quietly in your app and watches how users behave:
- When they log in
- Which features they use
- How often they visit
- Payment and billing patterns

### 2. AI Analysis
Our artificial intelligence compares each user's behavior to patterns from thousands of other SaaS customers. It learns what behaviors typically lead to cancellation.

### 3. Risk Scoring
Every user gets a "churn risk score" from 0-100:
- **0-30**: Happy and engaged
- **31-70**: Showing some warning signs
- **71-100**: High risk of canceling soon

### 4. Automatic Actions
When someone hits high risk, Churnaizer automatically:
- Sends them a personalized retention email
- Notifies your customer success team
- Triggers actions in your CRM or support tools
