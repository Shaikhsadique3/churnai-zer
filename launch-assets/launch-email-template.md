### Email Body

Hi [First Name],

Every SaaS founder knows this gut-wrenching moment:

You log into your dashboard and see another customer has canceled. No warning. No complaint. No chance to save them.

What if you could see it coming 30 days early?

**Today, I'm excited to introduce Churnaizer** - the AI that predicts which customers will churn with 94% accuracy and automatically saves them before they leave.

## How It Works (3 Simple Steps)

**1. Track user behavior** with our 5-minute SDK integration
**2. AI predicts churn risk** with real-time scoring (0-100)  
**3. Automated retention emails** bring customers back before they churn

## Real Results from Beta Customers

**TaskFlow** (Project Management SaaS)
‚úÖ Reduced churn from 8% to 4.2% in 3 months
‚úÖ Saved $240,000 in annual revenue

**DataSync Pro** (Integration Platform)
‚úÖ 60% reduction in enterprise customer churn
‚úÖ $180,000 revenue recovered in 6 months

**CloudBase** (Cloud Storage)
‚úÖ Customer success team handles 3x more accounts
‚úÖ Automated system catches risks humans miss

## Why Traditional Churn Tools Fail

Most tools only tell you about churn **after** it happens. That's like trying to catch a falling glass after it hits the ground.

Churnaizer is different. We predict churn **30-60 days early** by analyzing:
- Login patterns and frequency
- Feature adoption and usage depth
- Billing health and payment issues
- Support interaction history
- Email engagement rates

When someone shows early warning signs, we automatically:
- Send personalized retention emails
- Alert your customer success team
- Trigger webhooks to your CRM
- Display targeted in-app messages
